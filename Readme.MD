I had made a command line Todo list using Python which can add delete or update the task as per needed.

To display out the Tasks in tabular format you need to install tabulate.
     use command : pip install tabulate

In this we use a dictonary to store task in format of key value pair and eventually append them in the list to see or retrieve them.

You just had to pick operation of your choice you want to perform on the dictonary.
